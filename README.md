#ðŸŽ“ SRJC Pathway Explorer
SRJC Pathway Explorer is a step-by-step tool designed to help students at Santa Rosa Junior College discover their best-fit academic path, built at the AWS Cal Poly SLO AI Camp 2025

This project uses a series of structured questions with interactive elements to:
- Understand students' interests and personalities
- Match them to one of SRJC's official Academic & Career Interest Areas (called Pathways)
- Recommend the most fitting majors and certificates
- Connect them with their SRJC House, a supportive student community

It's based on the validated Holland RIASEC career model, used by schools and career advisors across the country.
